## QuickAccess for KDE SC 4.5+ ##
adapted to KDE SC 4.5+ by Susan Janet Voitel <gfx AT spacepenguin.de> out of despair

First of all: I have no - I repeat NO - skills in coding. I even don't understand what I did here. 
I just looked into the sources for the trash widget before and after the change and tried to apply the same to the quickaccess widget. Astonishingly it works. But use at your own risk and please don't blame me for errors or expect help from me, I cannot, sorry.

I altered the files quickaccess.cpp and quickaccess.h but left the original files as quickacces.h.orig and quickaccess.cpp.orig so whoever wants to can have a look at the differences.

So what IS the difference?
Since KDE SC 4.5 the max. size of the panel can be set via systemsettings. When increasing the panel height the icons will adjust to that maximum size. With this patch the quickaccess widget is also able to do so. If you use the original non-patched 0.8.1 version with KDE SC 4.5 and increase the panel height the quickaccess icon will stay at max. size 32x32, ignoring systemsettings.

About:
======
I loved the Kickerapplett to browse through directories and 
since there is no replacement for KDE4/Plasma yet I thought 
I try to do something similar...
Well thats the result...

My work is based on the work of some other people, and they should be mentioned:
Robert Knight: pieces of code from Kickoff
Peter Penz   : IconManager

Bugs/Wishes:
============
email me: wirrkpf@googlemail.com

Install:
========
You need at least KDE 4.2, because the Plasma-API changed from 4.1 to 4.2

You will need the following packages and the corresponding devel packages:
-kdelibs
-libkonq

to install:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install

[sv] Alternatively you can use checkinstall instead of make install. Checkinstall builds a package that will be installed using the package manager of your distribution. If sudo is not configured please use "su" to become root before you execute "checkinstall" or "make install".

You have to restart plasma to find QuickAccess in the Add Applets dialog:
kbuildsycoca4
kquitapp plasma && plasma
